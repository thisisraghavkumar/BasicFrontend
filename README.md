# BasicFrontend

## Motivation

This app started as a demo to educate users how one can interact with Dataverse in React. As a side project I decided to create this app from scratch by adding all config used by modern development stacks by hand.

The UI uses Material UI.


## How to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run start`

The server will start running on port `1947` and the app is programmed to talk to a private dataverse instance which cannot be accesses by any user, so please make appropriate changes to the authConfig file in the dataverse section, and actually wherever you find the mention of the dataverse org url.
